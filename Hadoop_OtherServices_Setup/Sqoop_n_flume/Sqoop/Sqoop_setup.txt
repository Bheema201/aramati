#we will need the connector jar file to enable sqoop to connect to mysql(already installed) and HDFS

Once done, untar sqoop,Create a link to these directories and update ur .bashrc with path of sqoop
$cd /usr/local
$sudo tar -xvf /home/hdu/Downloads/sqoop-1.4.7.bin__hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz
$sudo ln -s sqoop-1.4.7.bin__hadoop-2.6.0 sqoop

make hdu(my admin userid for hadoop) as owner of these directories and links
$sudo chown -R hdu:hdu sqoop*

$cd

Now copy the mysql-xxxxx.jar file from mysql-connector-java-5.1.48 dir in /home/hdu/Downloads
to /usr/local/sqoop/lib
$cp /home/hdu/Downloads/mysql-connector-java-5.1.48/mysql-connector-java-5.1.48.jar /usr/local/sqoop/lib

Also make sure mysql is setup on your machine.
#in our case mysql is already setup
#to check mysql access

$mysql -u hdu -p <enter>

for your hdu user update .bashrc

$source .bashrc
