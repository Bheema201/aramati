Verifying your CDH cluster
--------------------
Login to machine/machines and check the following
#note 'scm-server' need to be checked only on 1 machine/1st machine
service cloudera-scm-server status
service cloudera-scm-agent status

#before accessing web interface
http://<hostname>:7180

#check hostname
$hostname

#check ip address
$ip address

#make sure these details are right in /etc/hosts
#if not right, update
vi /etc/hosts

#if ip/hostname changed , we need to update 'config.ini' for each node where 'scm-agent' is running
--updated 'server_host= <ip>'

vi /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini

#if changes made successfully:
service cloudera-scm-server restart
service cloudera-scm-agent restart

--check status
--access web interface
--click on cluster > restart cluster

#we can later delete services which we don't need (we may have to configure dependencies )
